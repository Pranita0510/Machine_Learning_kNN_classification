**üìò k-Nearest Neighbors(k-NN) Classification:**

This Jupyter Notebook presents a step-by-step implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm for solving classification problems using Scikit-learn. The k-NN algorithm is a simple, intuitive, and effective method that classifies data points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors in feature space.

üîç Key Sections Covered:

*Importing Libraries:
    Utilizes essential Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and sklearn.

*Dataset Loading and Exploration

    Reading the dataset (CSV or built-in)

    Displaying feature information and class distributions

    Visualizing data (optional)

*Data Preprocessing

    Handling missing values (if any)

    Feature scaling (important for distance-based algorithms)

    Encoding categorical variables (if present)

*Train-Test Split

    Splitting data into training and testing sets using train_test_split

*Model Building & Training

    Using KNeighborsClassifier from Scikit-learn

    Choosing a value of k (number of neighbors)

*Prediction & Evaluation

    Making predictions on the test set

    Evaluating model using:

    Accuracy score

    Confusion matrix

    Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)

*Tuning & Visualization (Optional)

    Trying different values of k

    Plotting accuracy vs. k to find the best value

üõ† Requirements:

    Python 3.x

    Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

    pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
